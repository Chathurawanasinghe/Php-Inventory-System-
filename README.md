I am a PHP Application Developer - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly nseeded tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. I let you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.
